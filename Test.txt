I am going to market. I am Abir. I am very smart. Everybody likes me.   I am a    lovely person.
My son had very attractive eyes. He was different from everyone. He always brought happiness with him, every time he walked into the house.But he was always a mother’s boy. A smile was glued onto his lips. I was very disturbed because he was never serious. He had to laugh at everything. I quite often fought with him, tried to make him understand that life is very complex. He always laughed at me and behaved like a child. As a father, I wanted him to be serious. I had dreams for him, so many dreams. He would always give me a hug and gave me hope that one day he will be serious. I stayed disturbed about his lack of seriousness about everything. Even when he fell sick he laughed at his disease. I tried to save my son. I did everything I was capable of doing. During prayer I offered my life to God every single day. I asked him to have mercy on me and wanted him to take my life. I wanted to save my son. Whenever I went near him, he would hug me unnecessarily and punished me more with his laughter. I held his hands many nights in a fear of losing him. During the last days of his life; he often came to spend some time here, alone. This was his favourite place. When I asked him why he came to this place every day, his reply was ‘I want to breathe abba, it’s so difficult to breathe at home.’ My son was very right. I cannot breathe at home. I too run to this place now and try to breathe as much as I can. The worst punishment for a father is to bury his child’s body. No one can understand this pain except the one who have lost. Sometimes I feel my son is watching me from very near and I badly want to see him, badly want to hear his laughter. "
